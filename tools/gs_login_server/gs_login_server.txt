===============
1) Introduction
===============


This tool is a very basic and simple emulator of the Gamespy login
protocol, just like that used for gpcm.gamespy.com, gpsp.gamespy.com
and gamestats.gamespy.com.

It has been created for a friend of mine for the Dreamcast game PBA2001
but naturally it can be used for ANY existent game that uses the
Gamespy login and stat server.

As already said this tool is very very basic (for example it uses the
same "engine" for all the 3 services and uses some work-arounds for
compatibility and performances) so do NOT think to it like a real
server emulator, it is just a funny experiment.
Anyway it does its good job and I think the compatibility problems in
it are enough limited, in fact at the moment the only known problem is
that the PBA2001 client freezes if you click on the View Stats button
but you can bypass this problem uncommenting the "break;" instruction
in the source code (search for the "uncomment" pattern to find it).

I have also had tons of fun with Toca Race Driver 2 where you can go
online (create a new user or use an existent one, naturally all
invented since it is sent only to your local server emulator) using ANY
registered or unregistered nickname... really very very fun to play
online with any nickname!
And then that avoids to register everytime an e-mail address or the
same one (some games want re-registration although the account already
exists) on the Gamespy server which is a thing I personally hate, sure
registration is free but I hate to "be controlled" moreover when this
is not needed (look to the above example) and who controls is Gamespy.

But this is only one example, I think this tool can have many other
interesting or useless usages but at the moment I still don't know
them and leave everything in the hands of your fantasy.

2) How to use
=============


The tool requires that you specify the local TCP port to bind which can
be 29900, 29901, 29920 or any other which uses a similar protocol.
In the package is also contained the launch.bat file which
automatically starts the tool on all the 3 ports with the login
password pass (this is the password that all the clients MUST use to
login on this emulated server), so all with only a simple double-click
on this file.

Remember that the clients MUST point to your server emulator for using
it.
For example, if you want to test the nickname trick of Toca Race Driver
2 or ANY other existent game which uses the Gamespy login protocol
click on launch.bat and add the following lines to your hosts file:

  127.0.0.1   gpcm.gamespy.com
  127.0.0.1   gpsp.gamespy.com
  127.0.0.1   gamestats.gamespy.com

127.0.0.1 is the localhost IP address and so is only an example.
If you want to use the server emulator of your friend which has the IP
1.2.3.4 you must use this IP and not 127.0.0.1.

The hosts file is usually contained in the following folders, in any
case check the manual or the configuration of your operating system:

 Windows 95/98/Me       c:\windows\hosts
 Windows NT/2000        c:\winnt\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
 Windows XP             c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
 *nix                   /etc/hosts

If after the above changes the game crashes (some users reported this
problem with Battlefield 2) there are at least two solutions to try:
- instead of modifying the above hosts file try to create/modify the
  file hosts.ics in the same folder (suggested by Josue Monteiro)
- add also the following entries in your hosts file:
  127.0.0.1 battlefield2.available.gamespy.com
  127.0.0.1 bf2web.gamespy.com

Note that if in the game you don't have a new account or want to create
a new one you must simply use the "retrieve account" option of the game
because if you choose "create account" the game will first verify the
presence of the account you choosed and obviously gs_login_server
says that it exists (this is the job of the project) and so the game
will not continue.

For compiling the tool on Linux:
gcc -o gs_login_server gs_login_server.c md5.c -lpthread

3) Feedback
===========


This tool has been written for fun in a small amount of time and with a
look to the resources (no database, fixed buffers and so on).
If you have suggestions for expanding it and its features you are
welcome.
